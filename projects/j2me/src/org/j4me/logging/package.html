Provides application logging suitable for constrained devices.  The concepts are similar
to those in <a href="http://logging.apache.org/log4j/">Log4J</a> or the
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/">Java Standard Edition's logging package</a>.

<p>J4ME stores log messages in a circular buffer in memory.  This is very fast and memory
efficient.  The alternative is to use RMS to store the logs on the device's persistent
memory but this is <i>very</i> slow on a lot of devices and therefore inappropriate.
If you require this you should try <a href="http://microlog.sourceforge.net/">MicroLog</a>
which is more extensible, but much more heavyweight.

<p>When using the emulator for testing logs are output to the console window similar
to using <code>System.out.println</code>.  To see the logs on devices you need to have
screens that display them.  You can use the ones from the logging example directly.
You may want to "hide" the log from users by making it accessible through a secret
key combination such as holding down the "*" key for 3 seconds.

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>An example is provided in the <code>/examples</code> folder under the
<code>org.j4me.examples.log</code> package.  It logs the various J2ME optional
packages available on the device.
